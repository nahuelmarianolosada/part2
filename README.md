Challenge Api part2


Part 1
Write a program that prints all the numbers from 1 to 100. However, for multiples of 3,
instead of the number, print "Type 1". For multiples of 5 print "Type 2". For numbers
which are multiples of both 3 and 5, print "Type 3".
But here's the catch: you can use only one `if`. No multiple branches, ternary
operators, or `else`.
Requirements
● 1 if
● You can't use `else`, `else if`, or ternary
● Unit tests
● Feel free to apply your SOLID knowledge


Part 2
Now that our POC is complete, We could expose our functionality to our clients
through a REST API. To do that, we need to expose an endpoint to retrieve the value
of a specific number or its type and create a collection of numbers.
Requirements
● Make an endpoint to save a number into a collection.
● Make an endpoint to retrieve the value of a specific number.
● Make an endpoint to retrieve all the numbers in the collection.
● The value is either a number or a type as in our POC.
● You should save the collections in memory.
● Feel free to apply your REST design knowledge
